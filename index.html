            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Forgacs was a Colonel in the Hungarian Army, serving as a Military Officer in the Hungarian Armed Forces from 1961 to 1995.

            <p>From 1993 to 1994, Forgacs served as UN Military Observer (MILOB) at UNOMIL in Liberia. He was the first MILOB in the mission and was responsible for mission set-up and chairing the JACIG.

            <p>Forgacs' service in Liberia was recognised and praised by the UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the UN Security Council. In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali noted that Forgacs' "outstanding performance" had "contributed significantly to the success of UNOMIL".</p>
            <p>After his retirement in 1995, he was invited - because he served in three missions (UNOMIL, UNOMIG, UNMOT) where such successful cooperation was - by the UN DPK to write about his experiences under the title "Cooperation of UN Military Observers with regional Peace-Keeping Forces”. Accepting the offer, he spent 6 months at UN HQ in New York and wrote a 52 page paper (Guidance) with the above title, which was later used to train UN soldiers.</p>

                <h3>Situation in Iran (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The situation in Iran in 1988 was largely defined by the Iran-Iraq War, which had been ongoing since 1980. By 1988, the war had become a stalemate, and both sides had suffered heavy casualties and economic losses. The war was further complicated by the Iranian Revolution, which had taken place in 1979 and resulted in the establishment of an Islamic Republic led by Ayatollah Khomeini.</p>
                <p>As a result of the revolution, Iran had become a highly conservative and isolationist country, and its foreign policy was dominated by its anti-Western stance. The economy was also struggling with high levels of inflation and unemployment. In addition, human rights violations were widespread, and the country was subject to international sanctions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Situation in Iraq (not checked)</h3>
                <p>In 1988, Iraq was in the midst of a long and devastating war with Iran. The war had caused significant destruction and loss of life on both sides and had placed a huge burden on the Iraqi economy.</p>
                <p>In 1988, the Iraqi government was led by Saddam Hussein, who had taken power in 1979. Hussein had a brutally authoritarian rule, and the people of Iraq were subject to strict censorship, surveillance, and human rights abuses. In 1988, there was widespread unrest, with protests against the government, and the government responded with violent repression. The war with Iran had weakened Iraq’s economy and strained its resources, and the government was in a state of near bankruptcy by 1988. The country’s infrastructure had also been badly damaged by the war, leaving many areas without basic services such as electricity, water, and healthcare.</p>

                <h3>Iran-Iraq, 8 years of war (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The Iran–Iraq War, also known as the Imposed War (جنگ تحمیلی) and the First Gulf War, was an armed conflict between Iran and Iraq lasting from September 1980 to August 1988. It was initially referred to in English as the "Gulf War" prior to the Persian Gulf War of the early 1990s.</p>
                <p>The war began when Iraq invaded Iran on 22 September 1980 following a long history of border disputes and demands for the overthrow of the Iranian government of the Pahlavi dynasty.</p>

                <h3>Use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) is one of the longest and deadliest wars of the 20th century. It is also the only major conflict in the 20th century in which chemical warfare was used extensively. Both sides used chemical weapons throughout the war in an effort to gain an advantage. Iraq was the first to use chemical weapons, launching a series of chemical attacks against Iranian forces and civilians in the early months of the conflict. Iran has retaliated with its own chemical attacks in the later stages of the war.</p>
                <p>The use of chemical weapons in the Iran–Iraq War was widespread and is estimated to have resulted in around 100,000 casualties. The most commonly used chemical agents were mustard gas and nerve agents, such as sarin and tabun. Both sides used these weapons in an attempt to break the stalemate on the battlefield, but the use of chemical weapons did not have the desired effect. The war eventually ended in a stalemate, with neither side able to gain an advantage.</p>

                <h3>Iran-Iraq boundary as of 1988-89 (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The Iran–Iraq border has separated the two countries since the signing of the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639.</p>
                <p>There have always been border disputes between the two countries, primarily not for the purpose of gaining territory, but because there were very rich oil and gas fields in those areas. It was not even possible to agree on a border line recognized and accepted by both sides, which could also be recognized internationally. (This was one of the main reasons for the “8-years War” between these two countries.) That is why they agreed on an Internationally Recognised Boundary (IRB) between Iran and Iraq.</p>
                <p>As of 1989 the Iran–Iraq IRB runs for 1,599 km (994 mi) from the tripoint with Turkey in the north down to the Shatt al-Arab (known as Arvand Rud in Iran) waterway and out to the Persian Gulf in the south.</p>
                <p>Now the “border”, internationally recognized boundaries (IRB) consists of a demilitarized zone of 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) in width, with a fortified zone of 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) each side of the demilitarized zone. The border was heavily fortified by both countries during the Iran–Iraq War from 1980 to 1988.</p>

                <h3>End of the war according to UN Security Council Resolution 598 and 612 (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The war ended after both sides accepted Security Council Resolution 598 and as it was declared in Resolution 612.</p>
                <p><em>“Decides to set immediately, under its authority, a UN Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) and requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to this effect in accordance with his report; further decides that UNIIMOG shall be established for a period of 6 months, unless the Council decides otherwise.”</em></p>

            <div>
                <h3>Mandate of UNIIMOG (not checked)</h3>
                <p>UNIIMOG’s mandate, in accordance with resolution 598, was as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>To establish with the parties agreed on ceasefire lines based on the localities occupied by the two sides on D-Day (20 August 1988), but adjusting these, as may be agreed, when the positions of the two sides were Judged to be dangerously close to each other.</p></li>
                    <li><p>To monitor compliance with the ceasefire.</p></li>

                <h3>The UNIIMOG Mission (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The United Nations Iran Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) was a significant peacekeeping operation administered by the United Nations from 1988 to 1991. The inception of UNIIMOG was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council via the adoption of Resolution 619 on 30 May 1988, in response to the Iran-Iraq War. The mission's overarching purpose was to monitor the ceasefire agreement between the two nations and facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid.</p>
                <p>The distinguished mission was under the leadership of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) and Chief Military Observer (CMO), Major-General Slavko Jovic (Yugoslavia), with military observers hailing from more than 30 countries, including Hungary. These intrepid UN soldiers from 15 countries displayed remarkable valor as they patrolled the border areas of the two nations.</p>
                <p>The UNIIMOG mission in both Iran and Iraq was spearheaded by an Assistant Chief Military Observer (ACMO). The ACMO on the Iranian side was an Irish Brigadier General, while on the Iraqi side, the mission was steered by the experienced, capable, and qualified mission officer from the Indian military, Brigadier General V. Patil.</p>
                <p>Resolution 619 (1988) of 9 August, which endorsed the Secretary-General's report, was approved by the Security Council, leading to the immediate establishment of UNIIMOG for a period of six months.</p>
                <p>At its peak, UNIIMOG had a total military strength of approximately 400 ranks, including around 350 military observers. The participating nations that contributed military observers included Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, Poland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, and Zambia. New Zealand supplied an air unit, and the Observer Group also had military police from Ireland and medical orderlies from Austria. At the beginning of the operation, and pending the establishment of a civilian-operated communications system, a signals unit from Canada ensured the vital communications required by UNIIMOG. As with other peacekeeping operations, UNIIMOG had both internationally and locally recruited civilian staff.</p>

                <h3>The Structure of the Mission (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The UN Iran Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) established its Mission Headquarters (HQs) in two locations, namely Tehran and Baghdad, respectively. The mission officially began operations on 20 August 1988. Initially, the UNIIMOG Iraqi HQ collaborated with other UN premises in the area before eventually finding a suitable compound named the Canal Hotel to establish its headquarters.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Sectors (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The United Nations Iran Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) deployed military observers in a total of seven sectors, four on the Iranian side and three on the Iraqi side, in order to effectively monitor the ceasefire agreement between the two countries during the period of 1988 to 1991. Each sector was led by a sector headquarters stationed at strategic locations, such as Saqqez, Bakhtaran, Dezful, and Ahwaz on the Iranian side, and Sulaymaniyah (Northern), Ba'qubah (Central), and Basra (Southern) on the Iraqi side.</p>
                <p>The military observers were tasked with monitoring a significant stretch of the ceasefire line, with team sites located as close to the line as possible in order to minimize travel time between the team site and ceasefire line. The length of the ceasefire line monitored by a team site varied, ranging from 70 kilometers in the south to 250 kilometers in the north. This approach ensured that the ceasefire agreement was being upheld and that the flow of humanitarian aid was being facilitated in accordance with the UNIIMOG mission objectives.</p>

                <p>The mission in the Central sector was responsible for monitoring the border between Iraq and Iran, investigating ceasefire violations, reporting on military activity in the region, and providing assistance to refugees, with two Team Sites in al-Kut (South) and in al Mansuriya (North).</p>
                <p>The mission in the Northern sector was responsible for monitoring the border between Iraq and Iran, investigating ceasefire violations, reporting on military activity in the region, and conducting demining operations.</p>

                <h3>First UN Mission of Hungary (not checked)</h3>
                <p>Group of 15 officers led by Lt. Colonel Laszlo Forgacs was sent to UNIIMOG, 1988.</p>
                <p>In 1988, Hungary made its debut as a contributor to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission. 15 officers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Laszlo Forgacs, were dispatched to UNIIMOG. The objective of the mission was to monitor the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq, which had been established following the end of the Iran-Iraq War. The officers were responsible for supervising the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 598 and reporting any violations of the ceasefire.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian military officers selected for the UNIIMOG mission underwent rigorous preparation in areas such as health, military, political, security, and chemical defense to ensure that they were ready to depart for Baghdad on August 16, 1988. This was essential because the ceasefire was scheduled to come into effect at midnight on August 20, and the officers needed to be present at the ceasefire lines to "Show the Flag."</p>
                <p>The Hungarian Military Observers arrived on schedule and commenced their duties, representing the United Nations and hoisting the UN flag.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Role and Tasks of Hungarian Military Observers of UNIIMOG (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The Hungarian military observers were part of the United Nations Iraq-Iran Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) from 1988 to 1989. This was the first Hungarian mission in a UN peacekeeping mission, and the officers involved took into account the difficult situation they faced. In extreme circumstances, they stood up to the challenge and accomplished their task with excellence. They gained valuable experience that would later be applied to other UN peacekeeping missions.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian UN military observers were more or less evenly distributed in the three sectors and two remained in the staff of the HQ. Lt. Colonel Forgács received almost the greatest trust and honor when he was appointed commander of the Central Sector (HQ at Ba'qubah) as this Sector was considered one of the most important and sensitive.</p>
                <p>According to the operating procedure generally accepted in the missions, the Military observation staff was rotated every 3 months, so that those who performed their tasks in less favorable conditions were placed in more favorable conditions, and maintain a balance of command functions between nations.</p>
                <p>Only Lt. Col. Forgács retained his command position as the commander of the Central Sector. His deputy, a Polish Lt. Col. became the commander of the Northern Sector, the commander of the Northern Sector became the deputy commander of the Southern Sector, and so on.</p>
                <p>This was the greatest recognition and respect for the Hungarian military staff and for the Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
                <p>After an additional 3 months a new, so-called “regular” rotation has taken place. Lt. Col Forgacs as the commander of the first Hungarian UN contingent and the most senior Hungarian officer was transferred to the UNIIMOG HQ in Baghdad.</p>
                <p>The Iraqi mission leader (ACMO) assigned Lt. Col. Forgacs as ACLO/DVLO (Assistant/Deputy Chief Liaison Officer), deputy of CLO, Colonel Bustamante (Peru), having the task to contact with Iraqi Authorities, mainly with the Military Liaison Group of the Iraqi Army to settle and solve all problems and questions, differences between UNIIMOG and the host country.</p>
                <p>This was one of the most important posts at the HQ, as it was here that matters concerning the whole mission could be handled, from the investigation of (alleged) ceasefire violations, to freedom of movement and personal immunity, to inviolability, to the CAA (custom), fuel procurement and so on. The task was also important and special, not the usual one, because it was necessary to understand what the mission wanted to communicate, ask for, achieve, and to "present" it in the way it should be presented in the Arab world.</p>
                <p>In addition, since Col. Bustamante, CLO - shortly after my appointment as ACLO - went to his home country, Peru, for a two-week vacation and did not return nearly for 2 months, so I had to stand alone both in terms of Command, HQ, and the host country (Iraq) with its official bodies. But I managed, it worked!</p>

                <h3>Situation in Angola in 1993</h3>
                <p>Angola in 1993 was in the midst of a civil war that had been raging since 1975. The war had been fought between the government of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the rebel forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). </p>
                <p>The war had been characterized by human rights abuses, famine, displacement, and brutal violence. There had been several attempts to broker peace, most recently the Bicesse Accords in 1991, which had been signed by both sides but had not led to a lasting peace. The United Nations had deployed a peacekeeping mission in Angola in 1991, but this had not been able to bring a lasting resolution to the conflict. </p>
                <h3>Task and Mandate of UNAVEM-II</h3>
                <p>The United Nations had deployed a peacekeeping mission in Angola (UNAVEM) in 1991, but this had not been able to bring a lasting resolution to the conflict, this is why UN Security Council decided in 1993 to establish UNAVEM-II with different mandate.UNAVEM-II was a peacekeeping mission conducted by the United Nations from 1993 to 2003 in Angola.</p>
                <p>Mandate of UNAVEM-II was to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>monitor the implementation of the 1991 peace agreement between the government of Angola and the rebel group UNITA,</li>
                        <li>facilitate the country’s transition to peace and security,</li>
                        <li>monitor the implementation of the ceasefire,</li>
                        <li>supervise the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants,</li>
                        <li>demobilization of UNITA forces, and the integration of UNITA personnel into the Angolan armed forces.</li>
                        <li>monitor the movements of military forces,</li>
                        <li>provide assistance in the implementation of national reconciliation measures, and help to coordinate humanitarian assistance.</li>

                <p>In 1992, the possibility arose at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Peace Operations Directorate, that the Hungarians could send a soldier with the rank of colonel to Angola as a regional commander.</p>
                <p>Forgacs thought it was a great idea, however he was the only colonel at the time with UN experience and a high level of English. They asked him if he wanted to go to Angola in 1993 for UNAVEM II. To which he replied; “only if I was healthy and if it was in the Hungarian interest.” They found Forgacs healthy and sent him to Angola.</p>
                <p>The plan was that he was to be the commander of the South-East Region, in Mavinga. There were six regions in Angola at the time and there was heavy fighting in 1993. It was quite a confusing situation, nobody knew what to expect. The Hungarian group were seen off at Ferihegy by representatives of the Ministry - he was traveling with ten Hungarian soldiers - and they “encouraged” them by saying that the situation was so far out that anything could happen.</p>
                <p>As it turned out later, it was a good idea to send a colonel because, given Forgacs’ rank, he was able to do a lot more for the Hungarian soldiers than anyone else had been able to do before. When Forgacs arrived in Luanda, his comrades outside told him that the situation had changed, that Mavinga had to be evacuated and that the staff were in Luanda. Leadership on UNAVEM then offered him another post, that of Commander of Northern Region (HeadQuarter/HQ in Luanda).</p>

                <h3>Liberian civil war (not checked)</h3>
                <p>The Liberian Civil War was an armed conflict that took place in the West African country of Liberia from 1989 to 1997. It was fought between the forces of the Government of Liberia, led by President Samuel Doe, and the rebel forces of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor. The conflict claimed the lives of over 250,000 people, displaced nearly a million others, and left the country's infrastructure devastated.</p>
                <p>The civil war began in 1989 when the NPFL launched a rebellion against the government of Samuel Doe. The war quickly escalated into a full-scale conflict that engulfed the entire country including many smaller “independent” fractions (as ULIMO, United Liberian Independence Movement, LOFA county fighters, etc.). Over the course of the war, both sides committed numerous atrocities against civilians and employed child soldiers, who were forced to fight in the conflict. In addition to the human toll, the conflict caused severe damage to the country's infrastructure and economy.</p>
                <p>ECOMOG's involvement in the Liberian Civil War began in 1993 when it launched Operation “Iron Fist”, an offensive against forces loyal to Liberian leader Charles Taylor. The operation saw ECOMOG forces launch a series of ground assaults and aerial bombardments in an effort to dislodge Taylor's forces from their positions. The operation was successful and Taylor's forces were forced to retreat.</p>
                <p>In addition to Operation “Iron Fist”, ECOMOG forces also provided humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by the war. This included providing medical care, food, and shelter to those affected. ECOMOG also provided security for the safe evacuation of non-combatants from the war zone.</p>

                <p>As a result of previous positive experiences, the Hungarian Defence Forces were able to delegate a military consultant who served as a PA (personal advisor) to the political leaders of the mission. The consultant, Colonel László Forgács, was part of every military decision made. His recommendations and advice was acknowledged in every single instance by the UN New York HQ.</p>
                <p>Col. Forgacs was called from the UNAVEM III (Angola) Mission to join the talks as Military Adviser to SRSG in August 1993.</p>
                <p>After nearly one week of negotiations, the parties involved (Liberian Government, NPFL, ECOMOG, ULIMO and the others) agreed on a Liberian Ceasefire Agreement, an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of a UN Mission (UNOMIL) under the supervision of the UN. Colonel Forgács, who had a wealth of experience in previous ceasefire agreements and monitoring at UNIIMOG and UNAVEM Missions, played a crucial role in the drafting and acceptance of all the agreements.</p>
                <p>Since the successful conclusion of the Geneva talks, and despite the SRSG's recommendation to the UN leadership in New York that Colonel Forgacs participate in the final plans in New York, there has been no response. I traveled back to Angola and continued my preparations to set up another (Uganda) mission.</p>

It is composed of troops from the 15 member states of ECOWAS, and is headquartered in Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
                <p>The ECOMOG forces were able to restore a semblance of order in the region. They were able to maintain a ceasefire between the warring factions, provide security for the civilian population, and restore basic services such as electricity and water. Additionally, ECOMOG troops were able to disarm and demobilize combatants from both sides of the conflict, as well as to train and equip a new unified national army.

            <p>UNOMIG was originally established on 24 August 1993 by Security Council resolution 858 (1993) to verify compliance with the 27 July 1993 ceasefire agreement between the Government of Georgia and the Abkhaz authorities in Georgia with special attention to the situation in the city of Sukhumi; to investigate reports of ceasefire violations and to attempt to resolve such incidents with the parties involved; and to report to the Secretary-General on the implementation of its mandate, including, in particular, violations of the ceasefire agreement. The authorized strength of the Mission was 88 military observers.</p>
            <p>Following the signing, in May 1994, by the Georgian and Abkhaz sides of the Agreement on a Ceasefire and Separation of Forces, the Security Council, by its resolution 937 (1994) of 27 July 1994, authorized the increase in UNOMIG's strength to up to 136 military observers and decided that the mandate of an expanded Mission shall be as follows:</p>

            <h2>Liberian Civil War</h2>
            <p>The Liberian Civil War was an armed conflict that took place in the West African country of Liberia from 1989 to 1997. It was fought between the forces of the Government of Liberia, led by President Samuel Doe, and the rebel forces of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor. The conflict claimed the lives of over 250,000 people, displaced nearly a million others, and left the country's infrastructure devastated.</p>
            <p>The civil war began in 1989 when the NPFL launched a rebellion against the government of Samuel Doe. The war quickly escalated into a full-scale conflict that engulfed the entire country including many smaller “independent” fractions (as ULIMO, United Liberian Independence MOvement, LOFA county fighters, etc.). Over the course of the war, both sides committed numerous atrocities against civilians and employed child soldiers, who were forced to fight in the conflict. In addition to the human toll, the conflict caused severe damage to the country's infrastructure and economy.</p>
            <p>ECOMOG's involvement in the Liberian Civil War began in 1993 when it launched Operation “Iron Fist”, an offensive against forces loyal to Liberian leader Charles Taylor. The operation saw ECOMOG forces launch a series of ground assaults and aerial bombardments in an effort to dislodge Taylor's forces from their positions. The operation was successful and Taylor's forces were forced to retreat.</p>
            <p>In addition to Operation “Iron Fist”, ECOMOG forces also provided humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by the war. This included providing medical care, food, and shelter to those affected. ECOMOG also provided security for the safe evacuation of non-combatants from the war zone.</p>

            <h2>Cease-Fire Agreement</h2>
            <p>The UN called on the parties to end the Liberian Civil War and peace talks began in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1993 under the leadership of the UN SRSG, Sir Trevor Gordon-Sommers. Col. Forgacs was called from the UNAVEM III (Angola) Mission to join the talks as Military Adviser to SRSG.</p>
            <p>After nearly one week of negotiations, the parties involved (Liberian Government, NPFL, ECOMOG, ULIMO and the others) agreed on a Liberian Ceasefire Agreement, an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of a UN Mission (UNOMIL) under the supervision of the UN. Colonel Forgács, who had a wealth of experience in previous ceasefire agreements and monitoring at UNIIMOG and UNAVEM Missions, played a crucial role in the drafting and acceptance of all the agreements.</p>
            <p>ECOMOG remained in Liberia until 1999 when it was replaced by the United Nations Mission in Liberia. During its tenure, ECOMOG forces helped to restore peace and stability to the country and helped to facilitate the election of a new government.</p>
            <p>In 1996, the factions reached a peace agreement in which Taylor was elected president, and the war officially ended in 1997. Despite the peace agreement, the country remained unstable and violence continued to be a problem in the years following the war. It was not until 2003 that the situation began to stabilize and the country began to rebuild.</p>

            <h2>ECOMOG</h2>
            <p>ECOMOG is the military force of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States). Established in 1975, ECOMOG is an international peacekeeping force that is intended to help maintain peace and security in the region. It is composed of troops from the 15 member states of ECOWAS, and is headquartered in Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
            <p>The ECOMOG forces were able to restore a semblance of order in the region. They were able to maintain a cease fire between the warring factions, provide security for the civilian population, and restore basic services such as electricity and water. Additionally, ECOMOG troops were able to disarm and demobilize combatants from both sides of the conflict, as well as to train and equip a new unified national army. These efforts helped to create a more stable political environment and paved the way for a lasting peace in the region.</p>
