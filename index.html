            <p>Forgacs' service in Liberia was recognised and praised by the UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the UN Security Council.

            <h2>Liberian Civil War</h2>
            <p>The Liberian Civil War was an armed conflict that took place in the West African country of Liberia from 1989 to 1997. It was fought between the forces of the Government of Liberia, led by President Samuel Doe, and the rebel forces of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor. The conflict claimed the lives of over 250,000 people, displaced nearly a million others, and left the country's infrastructure devastated.</p>
            <p>The civil war began in 1989 when the NPFL launched a rebellion against the government of Samuel Doe. The war quickly escalated into a full-scale conflict that engulfed the entire country including many smaller “independent” fractions (as ULIMO, United Liberian Independence MOvement, LOFA county fighters, etc.). Over the course of the war, both sides committed numerous atrocities against civilians and employed child soldiers, who were forced to fight in the conflict. In addition to the human toll, the conflict caused severe damage to the country's infrastructure and economy.</p>
            <p>ECOMOG's involvement in the Liberian Civil War began in 1993 when it launched Operation “Iron Fist”, an offensive against forces loyal to Liberian leader Charles Taylor. The operation saw ECOMOG forces launch a series of ground assaults and aerial bombardments in an effort to dislodge Taylor's forces from their positions. The operation was successful and Taylor's forces were forced to retreat.</p>
            <p>In addition to Operation “Iron Fist”, ECOMOG forces also provided humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by the war. This included providing medical care, food, and shelter to those affected. ECOMOG also provided security for the safe evacuation of non-combatants from the war zone.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="CFA">
            <h2>Cease-Fire Agreement</h2>
            <p>The UN called on the parties to end the Liberian Civil War and peace talks began in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1993 under the leadership of the UN SRSG, Sir Trevor Gordon-Sommers. Col. Forgacs was called from the UNAVEM III (Angola) Mission to join the talks as Military Adviser to SRSG.</p>
            <p>After nearly one week of negotiations, the parties involved (Liberian Government, NPFL, ECOMOG, ULIMO and the others) agreed on a Liberian Ceasefire Agreement, an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of a UN Mission (UNOMIL) under the supervision of the UN. Colonel Forgács, who had a wealth of experience in previous ceasefire agreements and monitoring at UNIIMOG and UNAVEM Missions, played a crucial role in the drafting and acceptance of all the agreements.</p>
            <p>ECOMOG remained in Liberia until 1999 when it was replaced by the United Nations Mission in Liberia. During its tenure, ECOMOG forces helped to restore peace and stability to the country and helped to facilitate the election of a new government.</p>
            <p>In 1996, the factions reached a peace agreement in which Taylor was elected president, and the war officially ended in 1997. Despite the peace agreement, the country remained unstable and violence continued to be a problem in the years following the war. It was not until 2003 that the situation began to stabilize and the country began to rebuild.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="ECOMOG">
            <h2>ECOMOG</h2>
            <p>ECOMOG is the military force of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States). Established in 1975, ECOMOG is an international peacekeeping force that is intended to help maintain peace and security in the region. It is composed of troops from the 15 member states of ECOWAS, and is headquartered in Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
            <p>The ECOMOG forces were able to restore a semblance of order in the region. They were able to maintain a cease fire between the warring factions, provide security for the civilian population, and restore basic services such as electricity and water. Additionally, ECOMOG troops were able to disarm and demobilize combatants from both sides of the conflict, as well as to train and equip a new unified national army. These efforts helped to create a more stable political environment and paved the way for a lasting peace in the region.</p>
